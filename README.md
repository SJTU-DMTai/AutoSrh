## AutoSrh: An Embedding Dimensionality  Search Framework for Tabular Data Prediction

This repository is the official implementation of our TKDE paper: "AutoSrh: An Embedding Dimensionality  Search Framework for Tabular Data Prediction"
This paper proposes a novel end-to-end embedding dimensionality search framework named AutoSrh, which searches for mixed features embedding dimensions in a differentiable manner through gradient descent.
The key idea of AutoSrh is the adaptive dimensionality search process which introduces a soft selection layer that controls the significance of each embedding dimension and optimizes the parameters according to modelâ€™s validation performance. AutoSrh further
employs a fine-grained pruning procedure to produce a flexible mixed embedding dimension scheme for different features and performs model retraining to improve the predictive performance. AutoSrh is model-agnostic, which can be applied to various architectures of deep learningbased
models for tabular data prediction.
